# Leaflet_exercise_Eberswalde
Data and code needed for Leaflet exercise
This repository was created in August 2018 as part of an internship at Hochschule fur Nachhaltige Entwicklung to accompany two tutorials: 
- creating a map in ArcMap, migrating it to Arc Online and establishing a geospatial data collection campaign on mobile devices
- recreating the map in a programmatical way using Leaflet JS: making a basic map and adding an existing point feature layer.
